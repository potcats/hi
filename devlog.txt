INITIAL DD REVIEW
  - We should cut down on features since it's looking super ambitious (too ambitious...) for the time we have for the project
  - Need to add a summary of what the project is to our design doc
  - Need to fix our component map so it's not strange
  - Need to assign roles to the role assignment section of the design doc
  - Need to add section to say where we're using JS and what we plan to do with it
  - Need to fix up our dbs, maybe add explanations if it still doesn't make sense
